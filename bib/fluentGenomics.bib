  abstract  = "DNA microarrays are a new and promising biotechnology which
               allows the monitoring of expression levels in cells for
               thousands of genes simultaneously. The present paper describes
               statistical methods for the identification of differentially
               expressed genes in replicated cDNA microarray experiments.
               Although it is not the main focus of the paper, new methods for
               the important pre-processing steps of image analysis and
               normalization are proposed. Given suitably normalized data, the
               biological question of differential expression is restated as a
               problem in multiple hypothesis testing: the simultaneous test
               for each gene of the null hypothesis of no association between
               the expression levels and responses or covariates of interest.
               Differentially expressed genes are identified based on adjusted
               p-values for a multiple testing procedure which strongly
               controls the family-wise Type I error rate and takes into
               account the dependence structure between the gene expression
               levels. No specific parametric form is assumed for the
               distribution of the test statistics and a permutation procedure
               is used to estimate adjusted p-values. Several data displays are
               suggested for the visual identification of differentially
               expressed genes and of important features of these genes. The
               above methods are applied to microarray data from a study of
               gene expression in the livers of mice with very low HDL
               cholesterol levels. The genes identified using data from
               multiple slides are compared to those identified by recently
               published single-slide methods.",
