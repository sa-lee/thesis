               Wickham highlights compatibility with knitr and RStudio. ggplot2
               is a data visualization package for R that helps users create
               data graphics, including those that are multi-layered, with
               ease. With ggplot2, it's easy to: produce handsome,
               publication-quality plots with automatic legends created from
               the plot specificationsuperimpose multiple layers (points,
               lines, maps, tiles, box plots) from different data sources with
               automatically adjusted common scalesadd customizable smoothers
               that use powerful modeling capabilities of R, such as loess,
               linear models, generalized additive models, and robust
               regressionsave any ggplot2 plot (or part thereof) for later
               modification or reusecreate custom themes that capture in-house
               or journal style requirements and that can easily be applied to
               multiple plotsapproach a graph from a visual perspective,
               thinking about how each component of the data is represented on
               the final plot This book will be useful to everyone who has
               struggled with displaying data in an informative and attractive
               way. Some basic knowledge of R is necessary (e.g., importing
               data into R). ggplot2 is a mini-language specifically tailored
               for producing graphics, and you'll learn everything you need in
               the book. After reading this book you'll be able to produce
               graphics customized precisely for your problems, and you'll find
               it easy to get graphics out of your head and on to the screen or

              `Cognitive Dimensions' Framework},
  author   = {T R G Green AND Petre, M},
  abstract = {The cognitive dimensions framework is a broad-brush evaluation
              technique for interactive devices and for non-interactive
              notations. It sets out a small vocabulary of terms designed to
              capture the cognitively-relevant aspects of structure, and shows
              how they can be traded off against each other. The purpose of
              this paper is to propose the framework as an evaluation technique
              for visual programming environments. We apply it to two
              commercially-available dataflow languages (with further examples
              from other systems) and conclude that it is effective and
              insightful; other HCI-based evaluation techniques focus on
              different aspects and would make good complements. Insofar as the
              examples we used are representative, current VPLs are successful
              in achieving a good `closeness of match', but designers need to
              consider the `viscosity ' (resistance to local change) and the
              `secondary notation' (possibility of conveying extra meaning by
              choice of layout, colour, etc.).},

               utilize DSLs. Then, where DSLs prove suitable, Fowler presents
               effective techniques for building them, and guides software
               engineers in choosing the right approaches for their
               applications. This book's techniques may be utilized with most

              this need, we developed GMQL, a new query language for genomic
              data management that operates on heterogeneous genomic datasets.
              In this paper, we focus on three domain-specific operations of
              GMQL used for the efficient processing of operations on genomic
              regions, and we describe their efficient implementation; the
              paper develops a theory of binning strategies as a generic
              approach to parallel execution of genomic operations, and then
              describes how binning is embedded into two efficient
              implementations of the operations using Flink and Spark, two

                 present a mathematical formalism based on set algebra for
                 frequently performed operations in DS data analysis to
                 facilitate translation of biomedical research questions to
                 language amenable for computational analysis. With the help of
                 this formalism, we implemented the Genomic Region Operation
                 Kit (GROK), which supports various DS-related operations such
                 as preprocessing, filtering, file conversion, and sample

              genomes in different biological and clinical conditions.
              Availability of millions of whole genome sequences may soon
              become the biggest and most important ``big data'' problem of
              mankind. In this exciting framework, we recently proposed a new
              paradigm to raise the level of abstraction in NGS data
              management, by introducing a GenoMetric Query Language (GMQL) and
              demonstrating its usefulness through several biological query
              examples. Leveraging on that effort, here we motivate and
              formalize GMQL operations, especially focusing on the most
              characteristic and domain-specific ones. Furthermore, we address
              their efficient implementation and illustrate the architecture of
              the new software system that we have developed for their
              execution on big genomic data in a cloud computing environment,
              providing the evaluation of its performance. The new system
              implementation is available for download at the GMQL website
              (http://www.bioinformatics.deib.polimi.it/GMQL/); GMQL can also
              be tested through a set of predefined queries on ENCODE and

  abstract    = {BACKGROUND: The impressively low cost and improved quality of
                 genome sequencing provides to researchers of genetic diseases,
                 such as cancer, a powerful tool to better understand the
                 underlying genetic mechanisms of those diseases and treat them
                 with effective targeted therapies. Thus, a number of projects
                 today sequence the DNA of large patient populations each of
                 which produces at least hundreds of terra-bytes of data. Now
                 the challenge is to provide the produced data on demand to
                 interested parties. RESULTS: In this paper, we show that the
                 response to this challenge is a modified version of Spark SQL,
                 a distributed SQL execution engine, that handles efficiently
                 joins that use genomic intervals as keys. With this
                 modification, Spark SQL serves such joins more than 50$\times$
                 faster than its existing brute force approach and 8$\times$
                 faster than similar distributed implementations. Thus, Spark
                 SQL can replace existing practices to retrieve genomic data
                 and, as we show, allow users to reduce the number of lines of
                 software code that needs to be developed to query such data by
                 an order of magnitude.},

                 genomic features is a fundamental task in genomics research.
                 However, searching for overlaps between features with existing
                 web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that
                 are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies.
                 Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex
                 questions of these data in an efficient manner. RESULTS: This
                 article introduces a new software suite for the comparison,
                 manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser
                 Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format.
                 BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments
                 in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are
                 extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large
                 datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both
                 public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be
                 combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX
                 commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as
                 pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large

              tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data
              tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and
              visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a
              column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational
              unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy
              datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal
              with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes
              it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that
              both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a

                 entry into interdisciplinary scientific research, and
                 promoting the achievement of remote reproducibility of

  abstract    = {MOTIVATION: With high-throughput DNA sequencing costs dropping
                 <\$1000 for human genomes, data storage, retrieval and
                 analysis are the major bottlenecks in biological studies. To
                 address the large-data challenges, we advocate a clean
                 separation between the evidence collection and the inference
                 in variant calling. We define and implement a Genome Query
                 Language (GQL) that allows for the rapid collection of
                 evidence needed for calling variants. RESULTS: We provide a
                 number of cases to showcase the use of GQL for complex
                 evidence collection, such as the evidence for large structural
                 variations. Specifically, typical GQL queries can be written
                 in 5-10 lines of high-level code and search large datasets
                 (100 GB) in minutes. We also demonstrate its complementarity
                 with other variant calling tools. Popular variant calling
                 tools can achieve one order of magnitude speed-up by using GQL
                 to retrieve evidence. Finally, we show how GQL can be used to
                 query and compare multiple datasets. By separating the
                 evidence and inference for variant calling, it frees all
                 variant detection tools from the data intensive evidence
                 collection and focuses on statistical inference. AVAILABILITY:

                 of genetic variation and its association with human disease,
                 but epigenomic studies lack a similar reference. To address
                 this need, the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium generated
                 the largest collection so far of human epigenomes for primary
                 cells and tissues. Here we describe the integrative analysis
                 of 111 reference human epigenomes generated as part of the
                 programme, profiled for histone modification patterns, DNA
                 accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression. We
                 establish global maps of regulatory elements, define
                 regulatory modules of coordinated activity, and their likely
                 activators and repressors. We show that disease- and
                 trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in
                 tissue-specific epigenomic marks, revealing biologically
                 relevant cell types for diverse human traits, and providing a
                 resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human
                 disease. Our results demonstrate the central role of
                 epigenomic information for understanding gene regulation,
                 cellular differentiation and human disease.},
