              background to explore the results of their sequencing experiments
              in a standardized setting. Users can upload pre-processed files
              with continuous data in standard formats and generate heatmaps
              and summary plots in a straight-forward, yet highly customizable
              manner. In addition, we offer several tools for the analysis of
              files containing aligned reads and enable efficient and
              reproducible generation of normalized coverage files. As a
              modular and open-source platform, deepTools can easily be
              expanded and customized to future demands and developments. The
              deepTools webserver is freely available at
              http://deeptools.ie-freiburg.mpg.de and is accompanied by
              extensive documentation and tutorials aimed at conveying the
              principles of deep-sequencing data analysis. The web server can

  abstract = "Understanding relationships between sets is an important analysis
              task that has received widespread attention in the visualization
              community. The major challenge in this context is the
              combinatorial explosion of the number of set intersections if the
              number of sets exceeds a trivial threshold. In this paper we
              introduce UpSet, a novel visualization technique for the
              quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and
              aggregates of intersections. UpSet is focused on creating
              task-driven aggregates, communicating the size and properties of
              aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the
              visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set
              membership. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout
              and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries. The
              matrix layout enables the effective representation of associated
              data, such as the number of elements in the aggregates and
              intersections, as well as additional summary statistics derived
              from subset or element attributes. Sorting according to various
              measures enables a task-driven analysis of relevant intersections
              and aggregates. The elements represented in the sets and their
              associated attributes are visualized in a separate view. Queries
              based on containment in specific intersections, aggregates or
              driven by attribute filters are propagated between both views. We
              also introduce several advanced visual encodings and interaction
              methods to overcome the problems of varying scales and to address
              scalability. UpSet is web-based and open source. We demonstrate
              its general utility in multiple use cases from various domains.",

              required to remove a minute fraction of introns from human
              pre-mRNAs. Defects in this splicing pathway have recently been
              linked to human disease, including a severe developmental
              disorder encompassing brain and skeletal abnormalities known as
              Taybi-Linder syndrome or microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial
              dwarfism 1, and a hereditary intestinal polyposis condition,
              Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Although a key mechanism for regulating
              gene expression, the impact of impaired U12-type splicing on the
              transcriptome is unknown. Here, we describe a unique zebrafish
              mutant, caliban (clbn), with arrested development of the
              digestive organs caused by an ethylnitrosourea-induced recessive
              lethal point mutation in the rnpc3 [RNA-binding region (RNP1,
              RRM) containing 3] gene. rnpc3 encodes the zebrafish ortholog of
              human RNPC3, also known as the U11/U12 di-snRNP 65-kDa protein, a
              unique component of the U12-type spliceosome. The biochemical
              impact of the mutation in clbn is the formation of aberrant U11-
              and U12-containing small nuclear ribonucleoproteins that impair
              the efficiency of U12-type splicing. Using RNA sequencing and
              microarrays, we show that multiple genes involved in various
              steps of mRNA processing, including transcription, splicing, and
              nuclear export are disrupted in clbn, either through intron
              retention or differential gene expression. Thus, clbn provides a
              useful and specific model of aberrant U12-type splicing in vivo.
              Analysis of its transcriptome reveals efficient mRNA processing
              as a critical process for the growth and proliferation of cells

              provides high-performance alignment and read counting functions
              for RNA-seq reads. Rsubread is based on the successful Subread
              suite with the added ease-of-use of the R programming
              environment, creating a matrix of read counts directly as an R
              object ready for downstream analysis. It integrates read mapping
              and quantification in a single package and has no software
              dependencies other than R itself. We demonstrate Rsubread's
              ability to detect exon-exon junctions de novo and to quantify
              expression at the level of either genes, exons or exon junctions.

              of downstream statistical analyses using other Bioconductor
              packages. Using SEQC data and simulations, we compare Rsubread to
              TopHat2, STAR and HTSeq as well as to counting functions in the
              Bioconductor infrastructure packages. We consider the performance
              of these tools on the combined quantification task starting from
              raw sequence reads through to summary counts, and in particular
              evaluate the performance of different combinations of alignment
