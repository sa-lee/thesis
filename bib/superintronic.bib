  abstract = "limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an
              integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression
              experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex
              experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome
              the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma
              has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential
              expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data.
              The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading,
              normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities
              of limma have been significantly expanded in two important
              directions. First, the package can now perform both differential
              expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing
              (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously
              restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as
              well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and
              microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package
              is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression
              analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in
              terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order
              expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for
              biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This
              article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package,
              summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on
              recent enhancements and features that have not been previously
              described.",

  abstract = "Read alignment is an ongoing challenge for the analysis of data
              from sequencing technologies. This article proposes an elegantly
              simple multi-seed strategy, called seed-and-vote, for mapping
              reads to a reference genome. The new strategy chooses the mapped
              genomic location for the read directly from the seeds. It uses a
              relatively large number of short seeds (called subreads)
              extracted from each read and allows all the seeds to vote on the
              optimal location. When the read length is <160 bp, overlapping
              subreads are used. More conventional alignment algorithms are
              then used to fill in detailed mismatch and indel information
              between the subreads that make up the winning voting block. The
              strategy is fast because the overall genomic location has already
              been chosen before the detailed alignment is done. It is
              sensitive because no individual subread is required to map
              exactly, nor are individual subreads constrained to map close by
              other subreads. It is accurate because the final location must be
              supported by several different subreads. The strategy extends
              easily to find exon junctions, by locating reads that contain
              sets of subreads mapping to different exons of the same gene. It
              scales up efficiently for longer reads.",

  abstract = "Understanding relationships between sets is an important analysis
              task that has received widespread attention in the visualization
              community. The major challenge in this context is the
              combinatorial explosion of the number of set intersections if the
              number of sets exceeds a trivial threshold. In this paper we
              introduce UpSet, a novel visualization technique for the
              quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and
              aggregates of intersections. UpSet is focused on creating
              task-driven aggregates, communicating the size and properties of
              aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the
              visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set
              membership. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout
              and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries. The
              matrix layout enables the effective representation of associated
              data, such as the number of elements in the aggregates and
              intersections, as well as additional summary statistics derived
              from subset or element attributes. Sorting according to various
              measures enables a task-driven analysis of relevant intersections
              and aggregates. The elements represented in the sets and their
              associated attributes are visualized in a separate view. Queries
              based on containment in specific intersections, aggregates or
              driven by attribute filters are propagated between both views. We
              also introduce several advanced visual encodings and interaction

              scalability. UpSet is web-based and open source. We demonstrate

              pre-mRNAs. Defects in this splicing pathway have recently been
              linked to human disease, including a severe developmental
              disorder encompassing brain and skeletal abnormalities known as
              Taybi-Linder syndrome or microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial
              dwarfism 1, and a hereditary intestinal polyposis condition,
              Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Although a key mechanism for regulating
              gene expression, the impact of impaired U12-type splicing on the
              transcriptome is unknown. Here, we describe a unique zebrafish
              mutant, caliban (clbn), with arrested development of the
              digestive organs caused by an ethylnitrosourea-induced recessive
              lethal point mutation in the rnpc3 [RNA-binding region (RNP1,
              RRM) containing 3] gene. rnpc3 encodes the zebrafish ortholog of
              human RNPC3, also known as the U11/U12 di-snRNP 65-kDa protein, a
              unique component of the U12-type spliceosome. The biochemical
              impact of the mutation in clbn is the formation of aberrant U11-
              and U12-containing small nuclear ribonucleoproteins that impair
              the efficiency of U12-type splicing. Using RNA sequencing and
              microarrays, we show that multiple genes involved in various
              steps of mRNA processing, including transcription, splicing, and
              nuclear export are disrupted in clbn, either through intron
              retention or differential gene expression. Thus, clbn provides a
              useful and specific model of aberrant U12-type splicing in vivo.
              Analysis of its transcriptome reveals efficient mRNA processing
