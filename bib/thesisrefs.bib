  abstract  = "Preface to First Edition Before writing the graphics for SYSTAT
               in the 1980's, I began by teaching a seminar in statistical
               graphics and collecting as many different quantitative graphics
               as I could find. I was determined to produce a package that
               could draw every statistical graphic I had ever seen. The
               structure of the program was a collection of procedures named
               after the basic graph types they p- duced. The graphics code was
               roughly one and a half megabytes in size. In the early 1990's, I
               redesigned the SYSTAT graphics package using - ject-based
               technology. I intended to produce a more comprehensive and -
               namic package. I accomplished this by embedding graphical
               elements in a tree structure. Rendering graphics was done by
               walking the tree and editing worked by adding and deleting
               nodes. The code size fell to under a megabyte. In the late
               1990's, I collaborated with Dan Rope at the Bureau of Labor
               Statistics and Dan Carr at George Mason University to produce a
               graphics p- duction library called GPL, this time in Java. Our
               goal was to develop graphics components. This book was nourished
               by that project. So far, the GPL code size is under half a
               megabyte.",

  abstract      = "Multivariate data is often visualized using linear
                   projections, produced by techniques such as principal
                   component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and
                   projection pursuit. A problem with projections is that they
                   obscure low and high density regions near the center of the
                   distribution. Sections, or slices, can help to reveal them.
                   This paper develops a section pursuit method, building on
                   the extensive work in projection pursuit, to search for
                   interesting slices of the data. Linear projections are used
                   to define sections of the parameter space, and to calculate
                   interestingness by comparing the distribution of
                   observations, inside and outside a section. By optimizing
                   this index, it is possible to reveal features such as holes
                   (low density) or grains (high density). The optimization is
                   incorporated into a guided tour so that the search for
                   structure can be dynamic. The approach can be useful for
                   problems when data distributions depart from uniform or
                   normal, as in visually exploring nonlinear manifolds, and
                   functions in multivariate space. Two applications of section
                   pursuit are shown: exploring decision boundaries from
                   classification models, and exploring subspaces induced by
                   complex inequality conditions from multiple parameter model.

               of document elements such as figures, tables, equations,
               theorems, citations, and references. Similar to LaTeX, you can
               number and cross-reference these elements with bookdown. Your
               document can even include live examples so readers can interact
               with them while reading the book. The book can be rendered to
               multiple output formats, including LaTeX/PDF, HTML, EPUB, and
               Word, thus making it easy to put your documents online. The

              sequenced library that are typically removed from downstream
              analysis. Only reads overlapping annotated exons are considered

              component sequenced, especially when examining poly(A) RNA
              samples. In this paper, we demonstrate that intron reads are
              informative and that pre-mRNA is the major source of intron
              signal. Making use of pre-mRNA signal, our index method combines
              differential expression analyses from intron and exon counts to

              looks for evidence of intron retention after accounting for the

              deficiencies and biases in previous works related to intron reads

  abstract  = "Omics data contain signals from the molecular, physical, and
               kinetic inter- and intracellular interactions that control
               biological systems. Matrix factorization (MF) techniques can
               reveal low-dimensional structure from high-dimensional data that
               reflect these interactions. These techniques can uncover new
               biological knowledge from diverse high-throughput omics data in
               applications ranging from pathway discovery to timecourse
               analysis. We review exemplary applications of MF for
               systems-level analyses. We discuss appropriate applications of
               these methods, their limitations, and focus on the analysis of
               results to facilitate optimal biological interpretation. The
               inference of biologically relevant features with MF enables
               discovery from high-throughput data beyond the limits of current
               biological knowledge -- answering questions from
               high-dimensional data that we have not yet thought to ask.",
