  abstract  = "Preface to First Edition Before writing the graphics for SYSTAT
               in the 1980's, I began by teaching a seminar in statistical
               graphics and collecting as many different quantitative graphics
               as I could find. I was determined to produce a package that
               could draw every statistical graphic I had ever seen. The
               structure of the program was a collection of procedures named
               after the basic graph types they p- duced. The graphics code was
               roughly one and a half megabytes in size. In the early 1990's, I
               redesigned the SYSTAT graphics package using - ject-based
               technology. I intended to produce a more comprehensive and -
               namic package. I accomplished this by embedding graphical
               elements in a tree structure. Rendering graphics was done by
               walking the tree and editing worked by adding and deleting
               nodes. The code size fell to under a megabyte. In the late
               1990's, I collaborated with Dan Rope at the Bureau of Labor
               Statistics and Dan Carr at George Mason University to produce a
               graphics p- duction library called GPL, this time in Java. Our
               goal was to develop graphics components. This book was nourished
               by that project. So far, the GPL code size is under half a
               megabyte.",

               data graphics, including those that are multi-layered, with
               ease. With ggplot2, it's easy to: produce handsome,

               struggled with displaying data in an informative and attractive
               way. Some basic knowledge of R is necessary (e.g., importing
               data into R). ggplot2 is a mini-language specifically tailored
               for producing graphics, and you'll learn everything you need in
               the book. After reading this book you'll be able to produce
               graphics customized precisely for your problems, and you'll find

              learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful
              structure, transform it, visualise it and model it. In this book,
              you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a
              chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you'll
              learn how to clean data and draw plots---and many other things
              besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen,
              and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these
              things with R. You'll learn how to use the grammar of graphics,
              literate programming, and reproducible research to save time.
              You'll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate
              discoveries when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data.",

  abstract = "State-of-the-art next-generation sequencing, transcriptomics,
              proteomics and other high-throughput 'omics' technologies enable
              the efficient generation of large experimental data sets. These
              data may yield unprecedented knowledge about molecular pathways
              in cells and their role in disease. Dimension reduction
              approaches have been widely used in exploratory analysis of
              single omics data sets. This review will focus on dimension
              reduction approaches for simultaneous exploratory analyses of
              multiple data sets. These methods extract the linear
              relationships that best explain the correlated structure across
              data sets, the variability both within and between variables (or
              observations) and may highlight data issues such as batch effects
              or outliers. We explore dimension reduction techniques as one of
              the emerging approaches for data integration, and how these can
              be applied to increase our understanding of biological systems in
              normal physiological function and disease.",
