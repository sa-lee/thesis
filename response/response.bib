  abstract  = "[We propose a rudimentary taxonomy of interactive data
               visualization based on a triad of data analytic tasks: finding
               Gestalt, posing queries, and making comparisons. These tasks are
               supported by three classes of interactive view manipulations:
               focusing, linking, and arranging views. This discussion extends
               earlier work on the principles of focusing and linking and sets
               them on a firmer base. Next, we give a high-level introduction
               to a particular system for multivariate data
               visualization--XGobi. This introduction is not comprehensive but
               emphasizes XGobi tools that are examples of focusing, linking,
               and arranging views; namely, high-dimensional projections,
               linked scatterplot brushing, and matrices of conditional plots.
               Finally, in a series of case studies in data visualization, we
               show the powers and limitations of particular focusing, linking,
               and arranging tools. The discussion is dominated by
               high-dimensional projections that form an extremely
               well-developed part of XGobi. Of particular interest are the
               illustration of asymptotic normality of high-dimensional
               projections (a theorem of Diaconis and Freedman), the use of
               high-dimensional cubes for visualizing factorial experiments,
               and a method for interactively generating matrices of
               conditional plots with high-dimensional projections. Although
               there is a unifying theme to this article, each section--in
               particular the case studies--can be read separately.]",
