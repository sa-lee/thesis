# Declaration {-}

I hereby declare that this thesis contains no material which has been accepted for the award of any other degree or diploma in any university or equivalent institution, and that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, this thesis contains no material previously published or written by another person, except where due reference is made in the text of the thesis.

This thesis includes 4 publications, two of which have been published and two 
which have not been submitted yet [@Lee2019; @Lee2020-ie].
As the core theme of my thesis is the development of software
interfaces for biological data analysis, and given the collaborative nature
of statistical computing and bioinformatics research; all of the included
papers in this thesis reflect and acknowledge the contributions of my 
co-authors. Of special note is chapter \@ref(ch:intron), which reflects my 
contribution (in the form of a software package) to the submitted manuscript entitled 
_Covering all your bases: incorporating intron signal from RNA-seq data_
[@Lee2019-mf], and includes new data analyses not found in the paper. 
The following table details the publications, including my and my fellow co-authors contributions:
