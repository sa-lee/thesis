# Conclusion and future plans {#ch:conclusion}

This chapter concludes the thesis and lays out the plans for future work.

## Software development

```{r software-impact}
library(cranlogs)
sugrrants_dl <- cran_downloads("sugrrants", from = "2017-07-28")
tsibble_dl <- cran_downloads("tsibble", from = "2018-01-09")
```

The research methods developed in this thesis have been translated into two open source R packages: **sugrrants** and **tsibble**, both of which are available on CRAN.

### sugrrants

The **sugrrants** R package provides graphical tools to display data in the familiar calendar style via the `frame_calendar()` and `facet_calendar()`. The associated research paper, a shorter version of Chapter \@ref(ch:calendar-vis), has been awarded the best student paper prize from ASA Sections on Statistical Computing and Statistical Graphics and ACEMS Business Analytics in 2018. There have been a grand total of `r format(sum(sugrrants_dl$count), big.mark = ",")` downloads from the RStudio mirror since it was released on CRAN; and it has been starred 34 times on the Github so far. The homepage at <https://pkg.earo.me/sugrrants> contains detailed documentation and a vignette on `frame_calendar()`.

### tsibble

The **tsibble** package is a domain specific language in R for representing and manipulating tidy temporal data. This package is aimed for the fundamental architecture that other temporal tools will be built upon. For example, a new suite of time series packages, titled ["tidyverts"](https://github.com/tidyverts), have been developed for the "tsibble" data object. The **tsibble** package has won 2019 John Chambers Statistical Software Award from ASA Sections on Statistical Computing and Statistical Graphics. It has been downloaded `r format(sum(tsibble_dl$count), big.mark = ",")` times from the RStudio mirror since it landed on CRAN; and it has received 176 stars on the Github. These metrics are the indicators of my research impact, the recognition by professionals, and the uptakes by users. The website (<https://tsibble.tidyverts.org>) includes full documentation and four vignettes about the package usage.

## Future work

### The grammar of forecasting reconciliation

### Visual methods for nesting and crossing temporal data

### Visual inference for temporal data

## Final words
